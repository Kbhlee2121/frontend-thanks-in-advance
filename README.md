# Thanks in Advance

Thanks in Advance was created as a capstone project for Ada Developers Academy C16. It is a one-stop-shop application for creating and managing wishlists for any and all occasions, such as for Christmas, Birthdays, Weddings, and more. Thanks in Advance helps make gift giving easier where the receiver is gauranteed to like the gift and can be convenient for those who have minimalist or selective family/friends. It can also be particularly helpful for those who always struggle to find the right gift and for those who have been giving gifts to each other for years and are just simply out of ideas. Rather than spending money needlessly on an item you're not sure the receiver will like, Thanks in Advance was created with the intention of allowing users to view each other wishlists and gift profile, make claims on each other items, and still have an element of surprise. (See future enhancements).
